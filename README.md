My first code when experiencing potential of database and python together. This code was written just after when I started learning coding first time and just after a week I wrote this code.

# console-based-school-management-using-python-and-postgres
console based school management using python and postgres .

It is very basic program which uses postgres as db and maintains school records like student details and also generate console based id cards.

To run this program you need to replace your postgres credentials with myone.

You will see these options when you will run the program

To add entery go in teacher section and first add a student. And then you can generate id card after going to student section.
This kind of id card it generates in console.
